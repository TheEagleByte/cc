# Important Notes

- Commit your code often using the `/commit` command.
- When committing code, do not include the Co-authored by Claude Code part.
- When needing to reference up-to-date code examples and documentation, use the context7 mcp server.
- When needing to check the UI for changes you have made, use the playwright mcp server to access the UI through a browser.
- When needing to break down and work through complex problems and task list, use the sequential-thinking mcp server
